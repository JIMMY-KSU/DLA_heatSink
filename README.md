# DLA_heatSink

This is a rhinoPython script that generates coraly shapes.

It is basically diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) on a mesh

To run this get rhino 5, make sure rhinoPython is set up, and then in rhino type "runpythonscript." Navigate to the folder where the script is saved and run meshDLA.py. It will ask to select a 'seed' mesh which will act as the base mesh. The seed mesh will be modified by the algorithm. Be patient, it tends to take a few minutes to run a simulation and the only indiciation it is running is the spinny beach ball of death (mac).  

There is an included 3dm file that you can use for the seed.

This is based on work by Jaap Kaandorp and Roeland Merks.
