# DLA_heatSink

This is a rhinoPython script that generates coraly shapes.

It is basically diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) on a mesh

To run this get rhino 5, make sure rhinoPython is set up, and then in rhino type "runpythonscript." Navigate to the folder where the script is saved and run it. It will ask to select a 'seed' mesh which act as the base mesh which is modified by the algorithm. 

This is based on work by Jaap Kaandorp and Roeland Merks.
